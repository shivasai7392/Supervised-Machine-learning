Ensemble Techniques

1.Bagging(Bootstrap Aggregation)

2.Boosting


1.Bagging

multiple models will be trained using the samples of main train data

and the for test data it will go through each of the model and output is selected by majority of votes for a class by voting classifier


2.random forest classifier

same bagging comcept but the models are decission trees

sampling will row wise and also feature wise

test data classification is by voting classifier

3.random forest regressor

same bagging comcept but the models are decission trees

sampling will row wise and also feature wise

test data output will be mean of all the models output
