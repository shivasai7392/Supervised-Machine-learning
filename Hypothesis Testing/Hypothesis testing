Evaluates 2 or more mutual exclusive statements


Steps  :  

1.Make initial assumption (Ho)

2.Collect Data  (Evidence)

3.Analyse Data to satisfy the initial assumption (Ho)(Null Hypothesis) otherwise it will satisfy alternate Hypothesis



____________________



Point 1 :  now we know null hythosis is true but no evidence to proove the n alternate hypothesis is selected and null hypothesis is rejected
 
Point 2 :  now we know alternate hypothesis is true but no enough evidence to proove then null hypotheseis is selected and alternate hypotheseis is rejected

                      Ho            H1
                      
     Do not Reject    OK           Type2 Error
     
     
     Reject           Type1 Error    OK
     
     
     
     Point 1 is Type1 Error
     
     Point 2 is Type2 Error
