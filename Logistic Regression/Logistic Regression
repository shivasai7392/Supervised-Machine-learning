It is used to solve a classification problem

mainly a Binomial Classification problem

we can solve this problem using linear regression but there will be some erros

refer fig 2

so we are converting this linear regression line into a sigmoid function


logistic regression tries to find the 
	N
max of Sigma Yi * (mXi)
	i = 1

because to reduce the cost of an outlier
		N
we use max of Sigma f(Yi * (mXi))
		i = 1

where f(z)= 1/1+e^(-z)


We can also solve multiclassification problem using logistic regression


the model will give probabilities of all the output classes for an observation and the highest probality class will be given as prediction for that observation

to do this in python

there is a parameter in LogistionRegression as multiclass = "ovr"

ovr means one Vs rest
