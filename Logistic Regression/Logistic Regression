It is used to solve a classification problem

mainly a Binomial Classification problem

we can solve this problem using linear regression but there will be some erros

refer fig 2

so we are converting this linear regression line into a sigmoid function


logistic regression tries to find the 
	N
max of Sigma Yi * (mXi)
	i = 1

because to reduce the cost of an outlier
		N
we use max of Sigma f(Yi * (mXi))
		i = 1

where f(z)= 1/1+e^(-z)
