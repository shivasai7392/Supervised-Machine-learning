We have a classification problem statement 

                                    TYPES
                                    
                                    
                    CLASS LABELS                PROBABILITY
                    
                    default probability         Here threshold will be set like 0.3,0.4 e
                    0.5                         then we will determine if less than 0.3 then output is class A otherwise class B
