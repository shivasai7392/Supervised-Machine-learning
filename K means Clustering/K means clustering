Step 1 : Input no of clusters (K)

Step 2 :Calculate centroid

Step 3 :Calculate distance

Step 4 :Group based on Minimum distance

Whenever a new datapoint is added in the cluster the centroid will be updated as the mean of the X and Y


What is the optimal value of K

This k means clustering algorithm uses a statistical technique known as WCV (Within cluster variation) to deduce the optimal value of k

        K    n
WCV = Sigma Sigma (Distance of point j from its closest centroid)^2   {n - no of observations}
        k=1  j=1
       
if k = 1 then WCV will be the largest

if k = n then WCV will be least (0)

When K inreases WCV will be decrease exponentially
for a particular value of k the decrease in WCV will be linear
